# Home Assistant - Meter Parser AddOn
[![BuyMeCoffee][buymecoffeebadge]][buymecoffee] ![Checks][checksbadge]
![Last release][releasebadge] [^1]

This is a Home Assistant AddOn (not HACS) to allow parse of dial and digits utility meters like water, gas, and electricity to provide energy consumption information to home assistant using a regular ip camera.

This repository is under alpha stage, so expect bugs and breaking changes.

### Highlights of what **Meter Parser** can do

* Parse Meters
* Provide a consumption sensor of `total_increasing` state type.
* Cheap IP or PoE cameras must do.
* Sensor may be used by energy panel in home assistant, or [Utility Meter](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/utility_meter/) integration to provide statistics and costs by any time span (monthly, daily, etc.)

### Potential Downsides

* Positioning a camera and getting a good image could be difficult.
* Could be hard to setup calibration parameters.
* To recognize digits, this project relys on OCR services on the internet. I am open to 
suggestions on better local libraries to scan digits. Recognizing dials is simple and local,
no internet connection or APIs are required.

## Reporting an Issue

File an issue in this Github Repository, add logs and if possible an image of your meter. Please redact sensitive information.

I also appreciate if you share the camera device specs and light conditions.
